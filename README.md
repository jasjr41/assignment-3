Iterative approach using loops

Recursive approach using function calls

Input Validation: Handles edge cases like negative numbers and zero

Multiple Test Cases: Demonstrates functionality with various sample numbers


task 2
A Python program that performs various mathematical operations on a user-input number.

Features:
Takes a numeric input from the user

Calculates three mathematical operations:

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number

Sine of the number (in radians)
